Generate Barcodes for Stock Production Lots
===========================================

This module expands Odoo functionality, allowing user to generate barcode
depending on a given barcode rule for Stock Production Lots.

The barcode will be used as the ``name`` of the lot, which effectively allows
this module to create automatic serialization rules for production lots.

For example, a typical pattern for production lots is  "042........." that means
that:
* the EAN13 code will begin by '042'
* followed by 0 digits (named Barcode Base in this module)
* a 13 digit control

With this module, it is possible to:

* Assign a pattern (barcode.rule) to a stock.production.lot

* Define a Barcode base: 
    * manually, if the base of the barcode must be set by a user. (typically an
      internal code defined in your company)
    * automatically by a sequence, if you want to let Odoo to increment a
      sequence. (typical case of a customer number incrementation)

* Generate a barcode, based on the defined pattern and the barcode base
